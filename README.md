# Chess-AI
I created a chess game desktop app, with a custom computer AI, only utilizing C++ and the SFML library
The AI is able to change and update its behavior based on the individual play of the user.



SFML is the only requirement. Will need the dll files to compile. You can find the SFML download here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
