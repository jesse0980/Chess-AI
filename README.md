# Chess-AI
I created a chess game desktop app, with a custom computer AI, only utilizing C++ and the SFML library.
The AI is able to change and update its behavior based on the individual play of the user.

The game is still in development, but the basic functionality and computer player algorithm is there.



SFML is the only requirement. Will need the dll files to compile. You can find the SFML download here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
